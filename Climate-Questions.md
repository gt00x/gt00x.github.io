### Climate crisis and global warming. What can individuals do to make the topic being addressed at appropriate importance?


Individuals can take various actions to raise awareness and address the importance of the climate crisis and global warming:

1.  Reduce carbon footprint: Reduce energy usage by turning off lights and electronics when not in use, using public transportation, carpooling or cycling, and eating a plant-based diet.
    
2.  Support climate-friendly policies: Contact local and national representatives to express support for policies that address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
    
3.  Consume sustainably: Choose products that have minimal impact on the environment, and avoid single-use plastics.
    
4.  Spread the word: Educate others about the urgency of the climate crisis and encourage them to take action. Use social media, participate in community events and join environmental organizations.
    
5.  Vote: Support politicians and policies that prioritize addressing the climate crisis.
    
6.  Divest from fossil fuels: Consider moving investments from fossil fuel companies to clean energy alternatives.
    

By taking these actions, individuals can raise awareness and bring the issue of the climate crisis to the forefront.

----
### Can you elaborate on point 6.


Sure, point 6, "Divest from fossil fuels", means to remove investments from companies that are involved in the production of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. This can include stocks, bonds, or other financial products that are tied to these companies.

The idea behind divestment is to reduce the financial support for fossil fuel companies, which are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and therefore to the climate crisis. By divesting, individuals can send a message that they do not support the continued extraction and burning of fossil fuels, which is the main driver of global warming.

Divesting from fossil fuels can also help to reduce financial risk. As the world moves towards a low-carbon economy, it is becoming increasingly clear that fossil fuels will eventually become uneconomic and valueless. Divesting from these investments now can help protect against financial loss in the future.

Additionally, investing in clean energy alternatives, such as wind and solar power, can help to build a more sustainable and resilient financial portfolio.

----
### Ok. But in reality there is no black and white. Oil companies also invest or say they invest in green energy development.


You are correct, there is no black and white when it comes to fossil fuel companies and their investments in renewable energy. Some fossil fuel companies have indeed started to invest in renewable energy sources and low-carbon technologies, often as a response to pressure from investors and the public. However, the scale and impact of these investments are often limited compared to their overall operations and investments in fossil fuels.

It is important to assess each company individually and consider the proportion of their business that is dedicated to renewable energy and their overall track record when it comes to environmental responsibility. Some fossil fuel companies may claim to be investing in renewable energy, but this may not necessarily mean that they are reducing their overall greenhouse gas emissions or taking meaningful steps to address the climate crisis.

For individuals who are concerned about the environment and want to take action, divesting from fossil fuels and investing in clean energy alternatives can still be a powerful way to send a message and have an impact. By supporting companies that are dedicated to developing and deploying clean energy solutions, they can help to build a more sustainable and low-carbon future.

----
### Some people might argue that we need fossil fuels and related companies for now, since we cannot switch to green alternatives quickly without risk or major impact


Yes, that is a common argument made by those who support the continued use of fossil fuels. It is true that many countries around the world still rely heavily on fossil fuels for their energy needs, and making a transition to clean energy sources will require significant investments and infrastructure development.

However, it is also important to consider the long-term risks associated with continued reliance on fossil fuels. The burning of fossil fuels is the main driver of climate change, which is already causing significant harm to communities and ecosystems around the world, and will have much worse impacts in the future if left unchecked.

Moreover, the continued extraction and burning of fossil fuels also contribute to air and water pollution, which can have serious health impacts, particularly for communities near fossil fuel production sites.

So while it is true that a transition to clean energy will require careful planning and implementation, it is also clear that the risks associated with continued reliance on fossil fuels far outweigh the short-term costs and challenges of making the transition. By investing in clean energy and reducing dependence on fossil fuels, we can create a more sustainable and equitable future for all.

----
### Some people still believe that it is impossible that human activities change the climate. And that climate Chance is just a natural process. What can we say about that?


There is a vast body of scientific evidence that shows that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are driving the current climate crisis. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group of thousands of the world's leading climate scientists, has concluded that it is extremely likely (greater than 95%) that human activities are the main cause of observed global warming since the mid-20th century.

This view is also supported by a large majority of the scientific community, including organizations such as the National Academy of Sciences, the American Meteorological Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

While it is true that the climate has undergone natural fluctuations in the past, the current warming trend is occurring much more rapidly than can be explained by natural factors alone, and is having unprecedented impacts on ecosystems and communities around the world.

Therefore, it is not accurate to suggest that climate change is just a natural process, and ignoring the role of human activities in driving the crisis will only make it more difficult to find effective solutions and prevent further harm.

### When was the last period when average global temperatures were elevated, e.g. by 2 degrees Celsius compared to nowadays


The last time the Earth experienced average global temperatures that were 2 degrees Celsius higher than present-day temperatures was around 3 million years ago, during the Pliocene Epoch. During this time, the Earth's climate was much warmer and sea levels were significantly higher than they are today.

The evidence from the Pliocene provides a glimpse into what the world could look like if the current warming trend continues. Higher temperatures would lead to further melting of the polar ice caps and glaciers, causing sea levels to rise and threatening low-lying coastal communities. Warming would also lead to changes in precipitation patterns and the distribution of plant and animal species, with potentially devastating impacts on biodiversity and food systems.

This is why the Paris Agreement, which was adopted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2015, aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible. By taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to clean energy sources, we can avoid the worst impacts of climate change and create a more sustainable and resilient future for all.

----
### What was the highest average global temperature compared to today


The highest average global temperature compared to today occurred during the Eocene Thermal Maximum, around 56 million years ago. During this period, temperatures were about 9-14°C (16-25°F) higher than today's average global temperature.

The Eocene Thermal Maximum was caused by a massive release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, most likely from volcanic activity and the release of methane from the ocean floor. This caused the Earth's temperature to rise dramatically, leading to significant changes in the planet's climate and ecosystems.

While the Eocene Thermal Maximum provides an example of what the world could look like in a highly warmed state, it is important to note that the current warming trend is occurring much more rapidly than at any point in Earth's history, and is driven by human activities rather than natural factors. This is why it is essential that we take action now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to clean energy sources, in order to prevent further warming and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

----
### Which species handled the conditions during Eocene Thermal Maximum period best and which species did not?


During the Eocene Thermal Maximum period, the species that were able to adapt to the changing climate and thrive included many types of tropical and subtropical plants and animals, such as palms, primates, and rodents. These species were able to expand their ranges into new areas as temperatures rose and forests and jungles expanded.

On the other hand, many high-latitude species, such as arctic and alpine plants and animals, struggled to survive in the warmer conditions and experienced declines or local extinctions. Cold-adapted species, such as the ancestors of modern whales and seals, also faced challenges as their Arctic habitats became less hospitable.

The Eocene Thermal Maximum provides a glimpse into what could happen to many species under future warming scenarios. As temperatures continue to rise, many species will be forced to shift their ranges to cooler climates or face declines or extinction. This is why it is important to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect ecosystems, in order to prevent further warming and maintain the diversity of life on Earth.

----
### Which areas around the world where affected most by the Eocene Thermal Maximum period and which less?


The Eocene Thermal Maximum period affected different areas of the world in different ways. In general, the areas that were most affected by the warming were those at high latitudes, such as the Arctic and Antarctica, and those with large ice sheets and glaciers, such as Greenland and Antarctica. In these areas, warming led to melting of ice and significant sea level rise, which in turn had major impacts on ecosystems and species.

On the other hand, areas closer to the equator, such as tropical and subtropical regions, were less affected by the warming. In these areas, temperatures were already warm, and the additional warming allowed for the expansion of forests and jungles and the proliferation of many types of plants and animals.

It's important to note that the effects of the Eocene Thermal Maximum were not limited to just one region of the world, and had far-reaching impacts on the global climate and ecosystems. The warming and sea level rise affected ocean currents and weather patterns, leading to changes in precipitation patterns and the distribution of species around the world.

Today, the effects of the current warming trend are similarly far-reaching and have the potential to affect every region of the world. This is why it is important to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent further warming, in order to protect the world's ecosystems and the diverse species that they support.

### Can you explain the word Pliocene and Eocene?


The Pliocene and Eocene are geological epochs that occurred millions of years ago and are part of the larger Cenozoic Era.

The Pliocene epoch lasted from 5.333 to 2.58 million years ago. During the Pliocene, the Earth's climate was generally warmer and more variable than today, and sea levels were significantly higher. This epoch saw the evolution of many modern mammal species, including early horses, rhinoceroses, and primates.

The Eocene epoch lasted from 56 to 33.9 million years ago. During the Eocene, the Earth's climate was even warmer and more tropical than during the Pliocene, with temperatures up to 9-14°C (16-25°F) higher than today's average global temperature. The Eocene saw the proliferation of many types of tropical and subtropical plants and animals, as well as the decline of cold-adapted species.

Both the Pliocene and Eocene provide important context for understanding the current warming trend and its impacts on the Earth's climate and ecosystems. By studying these past warming events, scientists can better understand the potential consequences of continued warming and inform efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent further climate change.

----
### Can you explain the literal meaning of Pliocene an Eocene?


The word "Pliocene" comes from the Greek word "pleión," which means "more," and the Greek word "kainos," which means "new." The term Pliocene was coined to refer to the epoch being more recent than the Miocene epoch, but older than the Pleistocene epoch.

The word "Eocene" comes from the Greek words "eos," which means "dawn," and "kainos," which means "new." The term Eocene was coined to refer to the beginning of a new era of the Earth's history, marked by the proliferation of new and diverse life forms following the mass extinction event at the end of the Paleocene epoch.

In a broader sense, both terms refer to specific intervals of geological time characterized by unique climatic and biological conditions, which have played important roles in shaping the Earth's history and the evolution of life on our planet.

----
### What was the mass extinction event at the end of the Paleocene epoch.


The mass extinction event at the end of the Paleocene epoch, also known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), was a major event in Earth's history that occurred approximately 56 million years ago. This event was characterized by a rapid and significant warming of the Earth's climate, with global temperatures rising by as much as 5-9°C (9-16°F) in a relatively short period of time.

The cause of the PETM is still the subject of ongoing research, but the most widely accepted explanation is that it was triggered by a massive release of carbon into the atmosphere, likely from volcanic activity or the release of carbon from permafrost in the Arctic. This carbon would have caused the Earth's atmosphere to warm, leading to the rapid and dramatic changes in the Earth's climate and ecosystems.

The PETM resulted in the extinction of many species, especially those adapted to colder climates, and the proliferation of new and diverse life forms in warmer regions. The PETM is an important event in Earth's history, as it provides insight into the impacts of rapid and significant warming, and serves as a cautionary tale for the potential consequences of continued warming and climate change.

----
### How did the earth carbon levels develop in the last million years or as long as it is known


Over the last million years, the Earth's carbon levels have undergone significant fluctuations, largely driven by changes in the Earth's climate. During this time, the Earth has experienced multiple cycles of glacial periods, with ice sheets expanding and retreating, and interglacial periods, with warmer temperatures and less ice.

During glacial periods, carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere were lower, around 180-190 parts per million (ppm), as the increased ice cover led to greater carbon uptake from the atmosphere by the ocean and land-based ecosystems. During interglacial periods, such as the current one, CO2 levels were higher, around 280 ppm.

In recent history, the Earth's CO2 levels have risen dramatically, from around 280 ppm in the pre-industrial era to over 400 ppm today. This rapid increase is primarily due to human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other land use changes, which release large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere.

These rising CO2 levels are leading to significant and ongoing changes in the Earth's climate, with global temperatures increasing and impacts such as melting glaciers and sea level rise, as well as disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity. To address this global challenge, it is crucial that we reduce our carbon emissions and transition to more sustainable and low-carbon practices.

----
### Where there other times when the global CO2 level was above 400 ppm?


It is believed that the last time the atmospheric CO2 levels were consistently above 400 ppm was several million years ago, during the Pliocene epoch, which lasted from 5.3 to 2.6 million years ago. During the Pliocene, global temperatures were 2-3°C (3.6-5.4°F) warmer and sea levels were 20-40 meters (66-131 feet) higher than today, which provides evidence that elevated CO2 levels can lead to significant warming and sea level rise.

It is important to note that the current level of CO2 in the atmosphere, which is over 400 ppm, is higher than it has been at any point in the last 800,000 years, and is rising at an unprecedented rate. The rapid increase in CO2 levels is largely due to human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which have released large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. The continued increase in CO2 levels is causing significant and ongoing changes to the Earth's climate, including rising temperatures and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity.

### Who was the first scientist or scientists that made note of global warming and warned about it.


The concept of human-caused global warming and its potential impacts has been studied by scientists for over a century. The earliest known warning about the potential for human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, to cause global warming and its impacts can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

One of the earliest scientific warnings about the potential impacts of global warming was made by Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius in 1896, who first proposed that the burning of coal and other fossil fuels could lead to an increase in atmospheric CO2 and result in global warming.

In the mid-to-late 20th century, scientists including George Woodwell, Charles Keeling, and Wallace Broecker made significant contributions to our understanding of global warming and the role of human activities in causing it. They conducted pioneering research that provided evidence for the link between increasing atmospheric CO2 levels and global warming, and warned about the potential impacts of continued warming, including rising sea levels and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity.

These early warnings by scientists helped to lay the foundation for the ongoing scientific research into global warming, and their work continues to inform and guide efforts to address this global challenge.

----
### Which countries where leading the early studies on global warming?


Early research on global warming was conducted by scientists from a number of countries, including Sweden, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France.

Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius was one of the first scientists to raise the alarm about the potential impacts of global warming, and his work laid the foundation for much of the early research in the field. In the mid-20th century, the United States became a major center for climate research, with scientists at institutions such as the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii making important contributions to our understanding of global warming and the role of human activities in causing it.

The United Kingdom also played a significant role in early climate research, with scientists at institutions such as the University of East Anglia and the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research conducting important work on the impacts of global warming and efforts to address it.

In France, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established in 1988, bringing together scientists from around the world to assess the latest research on climate change and provide policy-makers with the information they need to address this global challenge.

These early studies by scientists from a variety of countries helped to build a solid foundation of knowledge about global warming and its impacts, and their work continues to inform and guide efforts to address this global challenge.

### What are or were famous climate crisis deniers in the last 10 years


In recent years, there have been several individuals who have been prominent in denying the reality of human-caused climate change and its impacts. Some of the most well-known climate crisis deniers include:

1.  Donald J. Trump: Former President of the United States, who during his time in office frequently dismissed the reality of climate change and rolled back a number of key environmental protections.
    
2.  Marc Morano: American political commentator and founder of the website Climate Depot, who is known for his strong opposition to climate action and his promotion of climate skepticism.
    
3.  Myron Ebell: American political commentator and director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, who has been a prominent voice in opposition to efforts to address climate change.
    
4.  James Inhofe: Former United States Senator from Oklahoma, who was known for his strong opposition to climate action and his claims that climate change was a hoax.
    
5.  Rupert Murdoch: Australian-born media mogul, who has used his media empire to promote climate skepticism and opposition to climate action.
    

These individuals and their organizations have been influential in spreading misinformation about climate change, and their efforts have delayed meaningful action to address this global challenge. However, despite their efforts, there is a growing consensus among the scientific community and the public that climate change is real and that we must take urgent action to address it.

----
### What type of articles one can find on the website Climate Depot


Climate Depot is a website run by American political commentator Marc Morano that is dedicated to promoting climate skepticism and opposition to efforts to address climate change. The articles on the website often focus on questioning the science of climate change, disputing the consensus among climate scientists that human activities are causing global warming, and critiquing efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address the impacts of climate change.

The articles on Climate Depot often present a one-sided view of the climate debate, and they frequently rely on cherry-picked data and misleading information to make their case. The website also features commentary and analysis from prominent climate crisis deniers and skeptics, as well as articles from other conservative and libertarian media outlets that share their views on climate change.

Overall, Climate Depot is not a credible source of information about climate change and should not be relied upon as a source of accurate information about this critical global issue.

----
### Can you give more details on Myron Ebell


Myron Ebell is an American political commentator and director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a conservative think tank in the United States. He is known for his strong opposition to efforts to address climate change and his promotion of climate skepticism.

Ebell has been involved in climate policy for over two decades and has been a vocal critic of climate action and the scientific consensus on climate change. He has been involved in a number of high-profile campaigns to challenge the reality of human-caused climate change and to promote the use of fossil fuels.

Ebell played a prominent role in the Trump Administration's efforts to roll back environmental protections and withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change. He has also been a frequent commentator in the media, appearing on TV news programs, radio shows, and in print media to voice his views on climate change.

Despite his efforts, there is a growing consensus among the scientific community and the public that climate change is real and that we must take urgent action to address it. The vast majority of climate scientists agree that human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, are causing the Earth's climate to warm at an unprecedented rate, and that this warming is causing significant and widespread impacts on our planet.

----
### Does the CEI also deny climate change


Yes, the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) is a think tank that has a long history of promoting climate skepticism and opposing efforts to address climate change. CEI's views on climate change are at odds with the overwhelming scientific consensus that human activities are causing the Earth's climate to warm at an unprecedented rate and that this warming is causing significant and widespread impacts.

CEI has been involved in a number of campaigns and initiatives aimed at questioning the science of climate change and opposing efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to clean energy. The organization has received funding from a variety of sources, including fossil fuel companies, and has been criticized by environmental groups for its close ties to the fossil fuel industry and its promotion of climate skepticism.

Overall, CEI's views on climate change are not grounded in science and should not be relied upon as a credible source of information on this critical global issue.

----
### What are the current topics of research on climate change

### How big is the expected impact if transportation would be electrified. Would that reduce CO2 emissions significantly.


The electrification of transportation has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to the fight against climate change. According to recent studies, the transportation sector is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions globally, accounting for a significant portion of total emissions.

The switch to electric vehicles (EVs) is seen as one of the most promising strategies for reducing emissions from the transportation sector. EVs emit much less greenhouse gases than traditional gasoline or diesel vehicles, and when powered by clean, renewable energy sources, they can produce close to zero emissions.

However, the exact extent of the reduction in emissions will depend on several factors, including the rate of adoption of EVs, the source of the electricity used to power them, and the efficiency of the power grid. In order to maximize the benefits of EVs, it will be important to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and solar power, and to continue to improve the efficiency of the power grid.

Overall, the electrification of transportation has the potential to make a significant contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. However, it is important to continue to monitor the emissions associated with EVs and to invest in clean energy infrastructure in order to maximize the benefits of this transition.

----
### How high is the rate of diesel cars in the US compared to gasoline or EVs


According to recent data, the rate of diesel cars in the US is relatively low compared to gasoline or electric vehicles (EVs). In recent years, the popularity of diesel cars has declined in the US, and they now make up only a small fraction of the overall car market.

In comparison, gasoline vehicles continue to dominate the US car market, with a large majority of cars being powered by gasoline engines. However, the popularity of EVs has been increasing in recent years, with more and more people choosing EVs as their preferred mode of transportation.

Overall, the trend in the US has been toward a reduction in diesel cars and an increase in both gasoline and electric vehicles. The exact proportions may vary over time as the market for different types of vehicles evolves, but as of now, gasoline and EVs are much more prevalent in the US than diesel cars.

----
### How does the fuel efficiency of diesel cars compare to gasoline powered cars?


The fuel efficiency of diesel cars and gasoline powered cars can vary, and depends on several factors such as the engine design, vehicle weight, and driving conditions. However, in general, diesel cars tend to be more fuel efficient than gasoline cars.

Diesel engines are designed to operate at a higher compression ratio, which makes them more efficient in terms of fuel consumption. As a result, diesel cars tend to get better fuel economy, and are able to travel further on a single tank of fuel than equivalent gasoline cars.

However, the cost of diesel fuel is often higher than gasoline, and diesel engines can be more expensive to manufacture and repair than gasoline engines. Additionally, diesel engines produce higher levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which contribute to air pollution and have negative impacts on human health and the environment.

Overall, the fuel efficiency of diesel cars and gasoline cars can vary, and depends on the specific characteristics of each engine and vehicle. While diesel cars tend to be more fuel efficient, they also come with their own set of trade-offs and considerations, and may not be the best choice for everyone.

----
### How is the fuel efficiency of a average 2 liter , 150 HP diesel engine?


The fuel efficiency of a 2-liter, 150 horsepower diesel engine can vary depending on a number of factors such as the specific design of the engine, the weight of the vehicle, and driving conditions.

However, in general, diesel engines tend to be more fuel efficient than gasoline engines, and a 2-liter diesel engine with 150 horsepower can be expected to have a fuel efficiency that is somewhat better than a comparable gasoline engine.

As a rough estimate, a 2-liter diesel engine with 150 horsepower in a passenger car might have a fuel efficiency in the range of 35-45 miles per gallon (mpg) on the highway and 25-35 mpg in the city, depending on the specific vehicle and driving conditions.

It's important to note that these are rough estimates and that actual fuel efficiency can vary greatly depending on the specific engine and vehicle. The best way to determine the fuel efficiency of a particular engine is to look at its fuel economy ratings, which are typically provided by the manufacturer.

----
### Can you convert the above values to km per liter


Sure! To convert miles per gallon (mpg) to kilometers per liter (km/l), we can use the following conversion:

1 gallon = 3.78541 liters 1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers

So, for example, if a diesel engine has a fuel efficiency of 35 mpg, this would be equivalent to:

(35 miles) / (1 gallon) x (3.78541 liters) / (1 mile) = 13.15 km/l

And if the fuel efficiency is 45 mpg, this would be equivalent to:

(45 miles) / (1 gallon) x (3.78541 liters) / (1 mile) = 16.9 km/l

Note that these are rough estimates and that actual fuel efficiency can vary greatly depending on the specific engine and vehicle.

----
### And convert them to liters per 100 km please


To convert miles per gallon (mpg) to liters per 100 kilometers (l/100km), we can use the following conversion:

1 gallon = 3.78541 liters 1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers

So, for example, if a diesel engine has a fuel efficiency of 35 mpg, this would be equivalent to:

(100 kilometers) / (1.60934 miles) x (1 gallon) / (3.78541 liters) = 7.35 l/100km

And if the fuel efficiency is 45 mpg, this would be equivalent to:

(100 kilometers) / (1.60934 miles) x (1 gallon) / (3.78541 liters) = 5.83 l/100km

Note that these are rough estimates and that actual fuel efficiency can vary greatly depending on the specific engine and vehicle.

----
### How does the efficiency of a comparable gasoline engine look like in liters per 100 km


The fuel efficiency of a gasoline engine will depend on a number of factors, including the engine size, design, and technology. However, on average, a modern gasoline engine with a comparable power output to a diesel engine will typically have a fuel efficiency of around 8-10 liters per 100 kilometers (l/100km).

It's important to note that fuel efficiency can vary greatly based on the driving conditions, such as city driving, highway driving, and speed, as well as factors such as vehicle weight, tire pressure, and driving style. The actual fuel efficiency of a specific gasoline engine can be found in its manufacturer specifications or by looking up its fuel economy ratings.

----
### How much kerosine does a commercial long distance passenger plan consume for 1000 km?


The amount of kerosene (jet fuel) consumed by a commercial passenger airplane for a given distance can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, including the type of airplane, the number of passengers, the payload, the weather conditions, and the flight profile (e.g. altitude, speed, and fuel burn rate).

However, as a rough estimate, a typical long-haul commercial passenger airplane may consume around 3-5 liters of jet fuel per kilometer flown, which would be equivalent to around 3,000-5,000 liters of jet fuel for a 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) flight. This is a rough estimate and actual fuel consumption can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances of the flight.

----
### So the per passenger jet fuel consumption is roughly 1-2 liters per 100 km, right?


No, the per passenger jet fuel consumption is not roughly 1-2 liters per 100 km. The total fuel consumption of a commercial passenger airplane for a given flight is divided among all the passengers on board, so the per passenger fuel consumption would be much smaller than the total fuel consumption.

As a rough estimate, if a long-haul commercial passenger airplane consumed around 3-5 liters of jet fuel per kilometer flown, and had around 300 passengers on board, then the per passenger fuel consumption would be around 0.01-0.017 liters of jet fuel per kilometer, or roughly 10-17 milliliters per kilometer. However, this is just a rough estimate and actual per passenger fuel consumption can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances of the flight.

----
### How much cost 1000 liter of kerosene roughly


The cost of 1000 liters of kerosene, also known as jet fuel, can vary greatly depending on various factors such as geographical location, time of year, and local taxes. As of my knowledge cut-off in 2021, prices for jet fuel typically range from around $0.70 to $2.00 per liter, so the cost of 1000 liters could range from around $700 to $2000. It's important to note that prices for jet fuel can be highly volatile and can change rapidly in response to shifts in global demand, supply disruptions, and other factors.

----
### Which country or countries has the highest car gasoline prices in the world


As of my knowledge cut-off in 2021, the countries with some of the highest gasoline prices in the world include:

1.  Norway
2.  Iceland
3.  Netherlands
4.  Germany
5.  Belgium

It's worth noting that the prices of gasoline can vary widely within a country depending on local taxes, transportation costs, and other factors. Additionally, gasoline prices can change rapidly in response to shifts in global oil prices, currency exchange rates, and other factors, so it's difficult to maintain a definitive list of countries with the highest gasoline prices.

----
### How many years of oil reserves are believed to be available currently


As of my knowledge cut-off in 2021, estimates of global oil reserves vary widely depending on the methodology used and the assumptions made. According to BP's 2021 Statistical Review of World Energy, proven oil reserves at the end of 2020 were estimated to be approximately 1.7 trillion barrels. At current rates of production, these reserves would last for around 50 years.

It's worth noting that the actual amount of recoverable oil will depend on a wide range of factors, including technological advances, geopolitical stability, and changes in demand. Additionally, some estimates of global oil reserves may not take into account the effects of climate change and the need to transition to a more sustainable energy system.

### What would be the effects if all oil reserves were used up ?


The effects of using up all oil reserves would be far-reaching and significant. Here are a few key impacts:

1.  Energy: The primary source of energy for transportation and a significant portion of the world's electricity would be lost, leading to a need to quickly transition to alternative sources of energy.
    
2.  Economy: The oil industry is a major contributor to the global economy, and the loss of this industry would have a significant impact on employment, trade, and government revenues.
    
3.  Transportation: Cars, trucks, ships, and airplanes are all heavily reliant on oil, and the loss of this fuel would require a major overhaul of the transportation sector.
    
4.  Agriculture: Oil is used in the production of fertilizers and pesticides, so the loss of oil could impact food production.
    
5.  International relations: The control of oil reserves has been a source of political tension for decades, and the depletion of these reserves could exacerbate existing geopolitical conflicts.
    
6.  Environment: Oil extraction and use result in significant greenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollution, and habitat destruction. The loss of oil would need to be accompanied by efforts to reduce the negative environmental impacts of energy production and use.
    

In summary, the depletion of oil reserves would have wide-ranging impacts on the global economy, energy system, transportation sector, food production, and the environment, making it essential to transition to a more sustainable energy system.

### In this scenario, what other income flows do OPEC countries have to keep their economy working.


In the scenario where all oil reserves are used up, OPEC countries would have to find alternative sources of income to support their economy. This could include investments in other industries, such as tourism, manufacturing, or renewable energy, as well as the development of new sources of natural resources, such as natural gas or minerals. Additionally, some OPEC countries have large sovereign wealth funds, which could be used to invest in and support the growth of other industries within the country. Additionally, many OPEC countries have large populations, and thus could look to develop and grow their domestic markets, which could provide a new source of income and economic growth.

### How is the political system setup in OPEC countries in summary


OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) is a cartel of 14 oil-producing countries that work together to regulate the supply and price of oil in global markets. The political systems of the OPEC countries are diverse and range from absolute monarchies to republics to socialist states. However, a common characteristic of many OPEC countries is that they are heavily reliant on oil revenue and thus, their governments have significant control over the oil industry and the use of the associated wealth. In some cases, this control is exercised through state-owned oil companies, while in others, private companies operate under the supervision and regulation of the government. Additionally, many OPEC countries have limited political freedoms, with some being considered authoritarian regimes, while others have more democratic structures. However, despite these differences, the countries of OPEC are united by their shared interest in maximizing the value of their oil exports.

### What countries belong to OPEC


OPEC stands for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. As of my knowledge cut off, the current member countries of OPEC are: Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela.

----
### Which one of those countries are the most developed or least developed


The level of development in OPEC countries can vary greatly. Some of the more developed countries in OPEC include the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, which have diversified economies and high levels of wealth. Some of the less developed countries in OPEC include Venezuela and Angola, which have lower levels of economic development and less diversified economies that are heavily reliant on oil exports. However, it is important to note that development is a complex and multifaceted concept and can be influenced by many different factors such as education, health, infrastructure, and governance.

### Since how long is oil used as source for energy


The use of oil as a source of energy dates back to the mid-19th century when the first commercial oil well was drilled in Pennsylvania, United States in 1859. Since then, oil has become one of the most widely used and important sources of energy, playing a crucial role in powering many industrial, transportation and residential sectors.

----
### How much of the total oil has been used up since this time (1859).


It is difficult to determine the exact amount of oil that has been used since the commercial discovery of oil in 1859. However, it is estimated that over the past 150 years, the world has consumed more than 1 trillion barrels of oil. The rate of consumption has increased significantly since the 1950s, with the rise of industrialization and the widespread use of automobiles.

----
### What percentage of the total available oil has been used up so far


Estimating the exact percentage of the total available oil that has been used so far is challenging because it depends on factors such as the size of remaining reserves and the rate of discovery and extraction of new reserves. However, it is estimated that around half of the total oil that is economically recoverable has been extracted and consumed to date.

----
### Can oil currently be recovered from waste , used oil products, etc.


Yes, used oil products and waste oil can be recovered through the process of oil re-refining or oil recycling. This process can help to conserve the natural resources, reduce environmental pollution, and increase the supply of high-quality lubricating oil. However, the recovery rate of used oil products is limited by technical and economic factors, and only a small fraction of the total amount of used oil can be recovered and reused.
